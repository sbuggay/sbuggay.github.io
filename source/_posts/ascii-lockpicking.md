Over the years I've worked on and off on a roguelike where you play as a modern day serial killer. There were a lot of cool concepts and ideas I played around with for this theme. One of them was forced entry through lockpicking. Oblivion's system for lockpicking is actually pretty accurate to how it works in the real world so I adopted somethign similar. Here is an in-game gif of the lockpicking mechanic.
(With the pin ordering being shown for debug purposes.)
