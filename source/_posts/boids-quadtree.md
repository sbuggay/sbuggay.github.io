I have recently been binge watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) by Daniel Shiffman. In two of his videos he [creates a flocking simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM) and a [Quadtree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxEcs0w_kE). I thought it would be a good excercise to try and combine the two concepts.

I was fairly happy with the result. You can play around with the simulation here: https://devanbuggay.com/boids.

There is also another amazing YouTube channel by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ) where he creates [3D boids with collision detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw).
