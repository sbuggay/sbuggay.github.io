[bspview](https://github.com/sbuggay/bspview) is a tool to explore Quake/GoldSrc maps in your browser. 
You can see a live demo of this here: https://devanbuggay.com/bspview. I've supplied a few BSP files to explore that can be selected from the dropdown. You can also drag and drop any supported .bsp to have it loaded for you.

## Controls

- Click anywhere to lock the mouse pointer
- F - toggle fullscreen
- 1 - Cycle through mesh modes
- 2 - Toggle model volume visibility
- 3 - Toggle entity visibility
- Select a map from the dropdown to load it
- Drag and drop any supported .bsp on the window to load it
