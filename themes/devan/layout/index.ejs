    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Devan Buggay. I'm currently working as a software engineer for Microsoft focusing on react/redux, tooling, and
        performance. Before that I worked professionally on iOS apps and .NET applications, with nearly 8 years in the industry.
        When I'm not programming in my free time, you can usually find me playing CS:GO or DotA2.</p>
