<h1>Projects</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 16px;">Below is a partial list of select personal projects I have worked on, you can find more projects and experiments on my <a href="https://github.com/sbuggay">GitHub</a>. All of them are OSS and MIT licensed so do with them what you wish.
Projects with a date marks the last time they were updated and are not being actively worked on. All others are in active development to some degree.</p>
